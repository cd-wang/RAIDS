## RAIDS
Security is of primary importance to vehicles. RAIDS employs a lightweight machine learning model to extract road contexts from sensory information (e.g., camera
images and distance sensor values) that are used to generate control signals for maneuvering the car. With such ongoing road context, RAIDS validates corresponding frames
observed on the in-vehicle network. Anomalous frames that substantially deviate from the road context will be discerned
as intrusions. We have implemented a prototype of RAIDS with neural networks, and conducted experiments on a Raspberry Pi with extensive datasets and meaningful intrusion
cases.

## Quick Start
    For example as commaai_data_try:
    First we need to train a CNN model to extract feature from each image. we use CAN information(steering angle) as label to train the models.The dataset is divided into training and testing with the training part being 70%.
    In feature_extraction_2cnn file, use python train.py to train the model and save the best model.
    $ python train.py
    Then try to use intrusion CAN model code modifies some of the values in the  csv dataset and also adds a column to it specifying if is an attack or not (1=attack,0=no attack)
    In try_commai_dark_data_2cnn/attack_csv file, use python attack_model_abs_a_random.py to attack CAN.
    $ python attack_model_abs_a_random.py
    In try_commai_dark_data_2cnn file, use python feature_extraction_intrusion_detection.py to train and test intrusion detection with contest.
    The dataset is divided into training and testing with the training part being 70%.
    $ python feature_extraction_intrusion_detection.py
